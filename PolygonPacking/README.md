A sketch for packing random polygons, with the twist that they are rounded and the rounding is taken into account in the packing, so there is a bit of extra space to use where the "points" of ordinary regular polygons would have been. I use a grid to speed up the bounds-checking process when placing new polygons.

Example output:
